This game will be based on the horror stories from the west coast of Sweden .
The game will be completely free to download and play,
and we will to some extent make use of product placements,
where companies have to pay some money to get their advertisements on various things in the game.

and we will also sell merchandise and we also have ads on the official services
the website and the launcher where players can see the news and be able to 
download COMPLETELY free new stories ( Courses ) and updates.

any proceeds we will receive will go to the further development of on 
officially multiplayer server / website costs / cost of development etc.

get more! all the information about income / Expenses, will be made public to all
developers so thay will be able to Controll check that it is correct)
